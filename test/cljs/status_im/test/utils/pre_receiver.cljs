;; The tests in clocks.cljs only ensure that the local clock value is respected
;; and that new messages are always appended correctly so we get a locally
;; consistent view.

;; Additionally, a desirable property to have is that two people talking to each
;; other have roughly the same ordering of messages. Example:

;; A and B are different chats with different chat identifiers. The sent
;; clock-value represents that client's truth, but The Network (Whisper, etc)
;; doesn't guarantee _delivery_ order. This means a client can receive the
;; messages in the following ordering.
(def messages [{:id "a" :clock-value 1 :payload "a1"}
               {:id "a" :clock-value 2 :payload "a2"}
               {:id "b" :clock-value 1 :payload "b1"}
               {:id "a" :clock-value 4 :payload "a4"}
               {:id "a" :clock-value 3 :payload "a3"}
               {:id "b" :clock-value 2 :payload "b2"}])

;; Empirically speaking, "a4" arriving before "a3" happens when messages are
;; sent in quick succession, but the delay between these being delivered is
;; usually very small, i.e. <100ms.

;; Given this delivery order, we have a design decision to make. We can either
;; eagerly "commit" them, and thus update our local clock value to reflect the
;; order we see messages in. Alternatively, we can pause the commit/full receive
;; step and wait for some time for logically earlier messages arrive.

;; In 0.9.12 and earlier this is the behavior we had the former behavior, but
;; this breaks users expectation. The tests below showcases the latter behavior,
;; which can be turned on with a flag.

;; Invariant to maintain
